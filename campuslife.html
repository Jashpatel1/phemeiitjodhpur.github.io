It is a new experience decorating, marketing, and arranging a complete celebration with no one but your peers and friends. The freshmen invite their seniors and teachers to the celebration and it is a proud moment to present the event to their superiors. Then celebrating around the large Bonfire with everyone is a memorable site.
